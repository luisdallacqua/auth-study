# A small app about authentication

The main focus here is to understand how to do an authentication in a React App.

This project consists in two pages, one protected (profile page) by email and password (that use the [REQ|RES API](https://reqres.in/) to authenticate and generate the token), and another is the login page that is public.

To login in the app use:

```
    email: eve.holt@reqres.in
    password: cityslicka
```

## To run this project locally

```
yarn
&&
yarn start
```
